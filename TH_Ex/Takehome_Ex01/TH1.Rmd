```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'readxl', 'knitr')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```


# **Task 1** 
## Plot pareto chart 
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
orders <- read_xls("data/Superstore-2021.xls",
                  sheet = "Orders")
returns <- read_xls("data/Superstore-2021.xls",
                  sheet = "Returns")

# join orders table and returns table
joined_tab <- left_join(returns, orders,
                        by = c('Order ID' = 'Order ID'))
# compute the frequency of returns in regard of different sub-categories
# method 1 group_by()
freq_returned <- joined_tab %>%
  group_by(`Sub-Category`) %>%
  summarise('Returns' = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
# sort the data set in descending order
freq_sorted <- freq_returned %>%
  arrange(desc(Returns))
# Computing the cumulative frequency

# compute the cumulative frequency of returns by product sub-category. This task will be performed by using `mutate()` of dplyr package and cumsum() of Base R.
freq_cum <- freq_sorted %>%
  mutate(cumfreq = cumsum(Returns))

# check the structure and content of the tibble data frame 
str(freq_cum)
```


1. sort data first by **returns** then by **sub-category**

2. plot the Pareto graph in *three* steps:  
       1).plot the number of returns in points: `geom_points(y = cumfreq)`  
       2).connect the points: `geom_path(y = cumfreq)`    
       3).plot second y axis using the `sec.axis` argument in `scale_y_continuous`. Create the percentage by define the total return using `max(freq_cum$cumfreq)`  

3. adjust the *ticks* on the *x-axis* using `theme(axis,te.x = element_text())`, set angle argument to 90
 
```{r echo = TRUE}
total_return <- max(freq_cum$cumfreq)
pareto_cum <- ggplot(data = freq_cum, aes(x = reorder(`Sub-Category`, -Returns), y = Returns)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Returns),fill = 'deepskyblue4', stat = 'identity') +
  geom_point(aes(y = cumfreq), color = rgb(0,1,0), pch = 16, size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cumfreq, group = 1), color = "grey", lty = 1, size = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~(./total_return)*100, name = "Cumulative returns in%")) + 
  labs(title = "Pareto Plot: frequency of returns in different sub-categories", subtitle = "More than 80% of the returns are generated from 9 major sub-categories", x = 'Sub-Category') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
pareto_cum
```
### Tableau vs. R (ggplot2) in regard of data visualization  

Tableau is great for basic data exploration, visualization, and processing - table join, filter, etc., is very straightforward, relatively comprehensive, and interactive. Whereas, R is a language rather than software that encourages the users to write their scripts or find appropriate libraries to conduct the analysis, such as ggplot2. R provides more flexibility than Tableau regarding the type of visualization the users can generate.
Tableau is more hands-on and straightforward for data exploration and visualization,  but one might also face the risk of being locked into a single product. In contrast, R is more flexible yet requires more effort to generate interactive charts. However, users can easily export them into PNG or even web apps.

# **Task 2**
## Create a pyramid graph using ggplot2  
* A age-sex pyramid showing the demographic structure of Singapore by age cohort and gender. 

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse')
for(p in packages){
   if (!require(p,character.only = T)){
      install.packages(p)
   }
   library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
  
### Data Import
Importing data-set using `read_csv()` of `readr` package, useful for reading delimited files into a `tibble`  

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Reading the csv file as a tbl_df
df_pop <- read_csv("data/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv")
# Inspecting the structure of the data-set
str(df_pop)
```

### Data Wrangling  
Select the columns that would be useful for data wrangling, rename for more intuitive ones from ‘AG’, ‘Pop’ and 'Time' to ‘Age_Group’, ‘Population’ and ‘Year’, respectively.  

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_pop <- df_pop %>%
  rename('Age_Group'='AG',
         'Population'='Pop',
         'Year' = 'Time')
# verify if the columns have been renamed correctly
colnames(df_pop)
```

TOD (Type of Dwelling),Planning_Area and Year will not be used in the visualization, therefore it is necessary to aggregate the population measure excluding those levels of detail. This can be achieved by using `group_by` and `summaries` functions from the `dplyr` package to sum up population by *Sex* and *Age_Group*.  

```{r echo = TRUE}
agg_pop <- df_pop %>% 
  select(c("Sex", "Age_Group","Population")) %>%
  group_by(Sex,Age_Group) %>% 
  summarise(Population=sum(Population))
head(agg_pop)
```

Print the exhaustive list of **Age_group** categories for verification.

```{r echo = TRUE}
agg_pop$Age_Group <- as.factor(agg_pop$Age_Group)
levels(agg_pop$Age_Group)
```

Set the bar plots for male populations to the **left side** (thus *negative sign* `-`)  

```{r echo = TRUE}
agg_pop$Population <- ifelse(agg_pop$Sex == "Males", -1*agg_pop$Population, agg_pop$Population)
```

Create age-sex pyramid: pyramid charts are two bar charts with axes flipped  

```{r echo = TRUE}
pyramid_pop <- ggplot(agg_pop, aes(x = Age_Group, y = Population, fill = Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(data = subset(agg_pop, Sex == "Females"), stat = "identity") +
  geom_bar(data = subset(agg_pop, Sex == "Males"),stat = "identity") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = paste0(as.character(c(seq(2, 0, -1), seq(1, 2, 1))), "m")) + 
  labs(title="Women outlive men", subtitle = "Imbalanced gender distribution in the 'above 75' age-groups in Singapore")+
  coord_flip()

pyramid_pop
```
