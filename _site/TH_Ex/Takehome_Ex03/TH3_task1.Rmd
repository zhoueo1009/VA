##1.0 About the task
This [take-home exercise](https://isss608-ay2021-22t2.netlify.app/th_ex/th_ex03) requires to apply appropriate data visualization techniques learned in Lesson 3 or Lesson 4 to accomplish the following task:  
Create a data visualization showing average rating and proportion of cocoa percent (% chocolate) greater than or equal to 70% by top 15 company locations. 

For this task, chocolate.csv should be used and the chart applied here are from [Lesson 4: Fundamental of Visual Analytics]()

##2.0 Sketch of Proposed Design

In the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.<slide 9>

##3.0 Installing and loading the required libraries
In this exercise, infer, ggstatsplot and tidyverse will be used.

```{r echo=T}
packages = c('ggstatsplot', 'ggside', 'knitr',
             'tidyverse', 'broom', 'ggdist','dplyr')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p,character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```
##4.0 data wrangling

importing data

```{r echo=T}
chocolate <- read_csv("data/chocolate.csv")%>%
  mutate_if(is.character,as.factor)
glimpse(chocolate)
```
Remove the % sign and convert *cocoa_percent* into numeric for further calculation.
```{r echo=T}
sub('%','',chocolate$cocoa_percent)%>%
  as.numeric(chocolate$cocoa_percent)
```

top 15 location
```
top15->chocolate$company_location%>%
  group_by(`company_location`)%>%
  summarise(freqloc = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(freqloc))%>%
  top_n(15,freqloc)
top15
```

##Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods
The code chunk below computes the count of observations, mean, standard deviation and standard error of rating.
Top 15 company location
```{r}
avg_rating <- chocolate %>%
  group_by(company_location) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(rating),
    sd=sd(rating)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
avg_rating
```

The code chunk below is used to reveal the standard error of mean rating by company_location .

```{r}
ggplot(avg_rating) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=company_location, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=company_location, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean rating by company_location")
```

## Dual-y axis to plot proportion of cocoa_percent>=70%

```
Step 1:
Sort the top 15 company location by number
Step 2:
Y axis for average rating
Step 3:
dual-Y axix for proportion of cocoa%>=70%  
```
